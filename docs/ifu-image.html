<h1>ifu-image</h1>
<p>
<b>ifu-image</b> reconstructs a direct image of the field of the two IFU bundles, from
a set of IFU image files. The image of the object and field IFUs are stored in
a 2-d fits file, the object image as the primary HDU, and the field image as
the first fits extension HDU

<h3>Details:</h3>
<p>
If a flat-field file is specified in the parameter file, it will be used. This
file must itself be an _ifu file, produced by <b>ifu-image</b> (with <code>FLAT_FILE</code> set to
'none') from a direct IFU flat-field exposure.
<b>ifu-image</b> requires 1x1 binning. It also requires either a full 2048x4096 frame,
or a subraster with x width of 2048 and a y range extending to the top of the
chip, i.e.  x: 1 - 2048  y: n - 4096.
Because the individual fiber spots at the IFU output are small, good alignment
is important to correctly reconstruct the image. If in any doubt, adjust the
dewar offset file before running. The alignment of the image produced by <b>ifu-image</b> on the sky is TBD.
