<h1>mosaic</h1>
<p>
<b>mosaic</b> creates a mosaic image from the CCD fits files of a given exposure. The
output image is a square of size 8192/binning. If not all 8 fits files are
present, or if the files are subrasters, <b>mosaic</b> places the available images at
their correct position within the mosaic image.

<h3>Details:</h3>
<p>
The primary purpose of <b>mosaic</b> is to assemble the full IMACS camera image, for
viewing and manipulation with IRAF routines. Note that the assembled image is
not astrometrically accurate, the 8 chip images are placed immediately next to
each other, with no attention to correct chip offsets and rotations. The
coordinate system of the mosaiced image is, however, that used by the routines
<b>apertures</b>, <b>spectral-lines</b>, <b>spectral-map</b>, and <b>adjust-offsets</b>.
</p>
<br>

<p>
The routine <b>display8</b> also displays the images of all 8 chips in a IRAF image
window, with the same orientation and coordinate system. Which routine should
you use?  If your only purpose is viewing the image, and if the image is  a
full 8-chip 1x1 binned image, use <b>display8</b>; <b>mosaic</b> takes additional time to
run, and fills your disk with additional large files. However, if you wish to
do anything else with the assembled image (further processing, or examining
with IRAF routines such as imexam), or it you are working binned data or with
subrasters, you must use <b>mosaic</b>, since <b>display8</b> cannot handle these, and IRAF
routines like imexam need a real file to work with.
